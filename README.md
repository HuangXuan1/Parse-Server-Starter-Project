# Parse-Server-Starter-Project

This project was outlined by Rob. He wrote some codes so that we can just add our server to this android file.
The main idea of this project is to learn how to use an backend server. Because we can use Parse Server in AWS directly, we do not need to build 
our own database and try to manage it.
You can just download and sign up a new user. You can see the rest users and the image they posted. Also thanks to Nick to teach my how to 
use androd studio to build the front end decoration.
